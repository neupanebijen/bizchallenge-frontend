        To participate in our adventures like, Trekking, Hiking,
        &nbsp;Mountaineering etc. good health and physical fitness is required.
        For &nbsp;this reason, we strongly advise all clients to follow our
        pre-departure &nbsp;fitness recommendation, or see professional fitness
        instruction. If you &nbsp;suffer from severe muscular, chest, heart or
        bronchial disorders, or if &nbsp;you are a severe asthmatic you are
        strongly advised against &nbsp;participating. Tours take place in remote
        areas where there is little or &nbsp;no access to normal medical
        services, or hospital facilities for &nbsp;serious health problems.
        Evacuation, where necessary, can be prolonged, &nbsp;difficult and
        expensive. Medical and evacuation expenses will be your
        &nbsp;responsibility and therefore we require travel and medical
        insurance to &nbsp;cover air transfer evacuation and hospitalization
        expenses. We reserve &nbsp;the right to refuse any person the right to
        participate in a trip on &nbsp;medical or fitness grounds. If in doubt,
